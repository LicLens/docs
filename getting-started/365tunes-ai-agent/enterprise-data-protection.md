# Enterprise data protection

365TUNE's AI Agent provides intelligent assistance for Microsoft 365 management and optimization decisions. When you interact with the AI Agent, your prompts and the system's responses flow through a secure processing pipeline designed specifically for enterprise workloads. This article explains exactly how your data is handled, what security measures protect it, and how to configure enhanced protections for sensitive environments.

### Enterprise data protection for prompts and responses

365TUNE AI Agent offers enterprise data protection terms consistent with industry-leading practices for AI services. Use of the AI Agent involves prompts (queries entered by users) and responses (content generated by the AI). These interactions are protected by contractual commitments and technical controls.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Microsoft 365 data and queries sent to 365TUNE's AI Agent are **never used to train AI models** and used **only for the purpose of fulfilling the service request**.
{% endhint %}

Prompts and responses processed through the 365TUNE AI Agent are not used to train or improve underlying AI models. Your organization’s data remains private and is not shared across tenants or used for model development.

365TUNE has contractual guarantees that your data will not be used to train or improve AI models. This is a binding commitment in our commercial service agreements. When you send queries to the AI Agent, neither your prompts nor the generated responses are used for model development or improvement.

365TUNE also have implemented safeguards against prompt injections, harmful content generation, and data exfiltration attempts. All AI interactions are monitored for anomalous patterns.

### Access controls and permissions

The AI Agent operates within the security boundary of your existing Microsoft 365 and 365TUNE permissions:

Your permissions apply: The AI Agent can only access data that the authenticated user has permission to view in Microsoft 365 and 365TUNE. It respects all existing role-based access controls, security groups, and conditional access policies.

### What data is sent to AI processing

365TUNE applies data minimization principles when processing AI requests. Only the information necessary to respond to your query is included in AI processing. The platform automatically filters sensitive information before transmission.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top">Data category</th><th valign="top">Sent to AI processing</th><th valign="top">Protection measures</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">User queries and prompts</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Logged for audit, filtered for sensitive patterns</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Microsoft 365 configuration summaries</td><td valign="top">Yes, when relevant to query</td><td valign="top">Aggregated, anonymized where possible</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Usage statistics and metrics</td><td valign="top">Yes, for optimization analysis</td><td valign="top">Aggregated at organization level</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">License assignment data</td><td valign="top">Yes, for cost analysis</td><td valign="top">User identities minimized</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Passwords and credentials</td><td valign="top">Never</td><td valign="top">Excluded at platform level</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Email content</td><td valign="top">Never</td><td valign="top">Not accessed by AI Agent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Personal identifiable information (PII)</td><td valign="top">Minimized</td><td valign="top">Filtered and anonymized where possible</td></tr></tbody></table>

User queries, Microsoft 365 configuration summaries, and aggregated usage statistics may be processed to provide recommendations. Personally identifiable information is minimized or anonymized where possible. Administrators can configure additional filtering rules through the 365TUNE admin console.

### AI Agent backed by Microsoft Azure infrastructure

365TUNE's AI Agent runs on Microsoft Azure with enterprise-grade security controls. All data flows through Azure infrastructure before reaching AI processing systems, providing defense-in-depth protection.

The processing flow works as follows:

1. User submits query through 365TUNE interface
2. Query travels to Azure-hosted 365TUNE backend services
3. Request is processed through AI services
4. Response returns through the same secure path
5. Results display in 365TUNE interface

Microsoft's Azure Product Terms and Data Processing Agreement govern the infrastructure layer.&#x20;

### Encryption protects data in transit and at rest

All data transmitted to and from the AI Agent uses **TLS 1.2 or higher** encryption. This includes the complete request-response cycle from your browser through 365TUNE services to AI processing infrastructure.

Data at rest is encrypted using **AES-256 encryption** (256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard). Additional security measures include:

* **Data masking**: Sensitive fields are masked during processing where possible
* **Tokenization**: Data types requiring heightened protection use tokenization rather than clear-text processing
* **Network isolation**: Azure Private Endpoints and Virtual Network integration minimize exposure to public internet
* **API rate limiting**: Tenant-level throttling prevents runaway queries and abuse
* **Tenant isolation**: Your organization's data is logically isolated with no cross-tenant visibility

### Compliance certifications

365TUNE's AI infrastructure partner maintains certifications across major enterprise compliance frameworks:

### Sub processors and data sharing

365TUNE uses carefully vetted sub processors to deliver AI Agent functionality. A complete and current sub processor list is maintained by 365TUNE accessible for customers. You'll receive notification at least 10 days before new sub processors are added, with an opportunity to raise objections based on data privacy or security concerns.

### Frequently asked questions

#### Is my data used to train AI models?
