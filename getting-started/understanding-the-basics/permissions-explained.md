# Permissions Explained

365TUNE collects data from Microsoft 365 exclusively through the **Microsoft Graph API**, which provides secure and streamlined access to a wide range of Microsoft 365 services.&#x20;

## 1. **Application Registration and Permissions**

* During the initial setup, a **Global Administrator** grants **read-only permissions** to 365TUNE, including User.Read.All, Reports.Read.All and others. These permissions allow the tool to retrieve user profile data and usage reports without the ability to modify or delete any data.
* 365TUNE is registered as an application within Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), enabling it to securely access Microsoft 365 data.
* 365TUNE does not store Global Admin credentials. It uses secure authentication through **OAuth 2.0** to access the necessary data.

Below are the detailed breakdown of permissions requested during the onboarding/app registration process.

**Microsoft Graph Permissions:**

<table><thead><tr><th width="197">Permission Names</th><th width="160.33333333333331">Permission Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AuditLog.Read.All</td><td>Application</td><td>Read audit log data from Microsoft 365</td></tr><tr><td>Directory.Read.All</td><td>Application</td><td>Read directory data Entra ID. Example: Get assigned licenses details of a user</td></tr><tr><td>Mail.ReadBasic</td><td>Application</td><td>Read basic mail in all mailboxes. This does not grand access to email contents.</td></tr><tr><td>Reports.Read.All</td><td>Application</td><td>Read usage reports from Microsoft 365</td></tr><tr><td>User.Read.All</td><td>Application</td><td>Read users' profiles to fetch details. Example: Cost Center</td></tr><tr><td>UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All</td><td>Application</td><td>Read users' authentication methods. </td></tr></tbody></table>

## 2. **Using Microsoft Graph API**

* After the initial setup and permission approval, 365TUNE interacts solely with the **Microsoft Graph API**, which is the gateway to Microsoft 365 data. The Graph API enables access to a variety of data, including:
  * **User data**: Information on users, their assigned licenses, and roles.
  * **Usage data**: Activity and usage reports from services like Exchange, Teams, and OneDrive.
* 365TUNE makes **API calls** to Microsoft Graph endpoints to collect this data in real-time.

## 3. **Secure Data Access**

* 365TUNE uses **OAuth 2.0 tokens** to authenticate API requests. These tokens are obtained once the Global Administrato**r** grants consent and will be used for subsequent requests to Microsoft Graph.
* This method ensures that 365TUNE accesses the data securely and does not require storing any sensitive credentials. It operates with the granted **read-only permissions**, ensuring that it can only **view and analyze** data without the ability to make changes.
* 365TUNE sends requests to Microsoft Graph API to retrieve specific datasets such as:
  * **User profiles**: Data about users, their licenses, and assigned roles.
  * **Reports**: License usage, activity metrics, and other compliance reports.
* The data collected is then analyzed and compiled into reports, which help administrators monitor license consumption and user activity across the organization.

## Conclusion

365TUNE relies entirely on **Microsoft Graph API** for collecting and analyzing data from Microsoft 365. By using secure OAuth 2.0 authentication and read-only permissions, 365TUNE ensures that it can gather important insights without compromising data integrity or requiring continuous admin access. The toolâ€™s ability to operate solely via the Microsoft Graph API makes it both secure and efficient for reporting and compliance monitoring.
