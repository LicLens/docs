# Update Custom Attributes

{% hint style="info" %}
This article explains how to map your existing Extention Attributes from Active Directory in to the 365TUNE reports. If you do not use Extention Attributes in AD and want to know how to incorporate certain attributes such as Cost Code or Project ID in to the reports, [read this](upload-custom-attributes.md).
{% endhint %}

Organizations often utilize custom attributes in Active Directory or Microsoft Entra ID to store specific information that is not available by default. Examples of such attributes include an employee's **Cost Code**, **Project ID**, or **Department Code**, which are essential for accurate financial reporting and compliance.

365TUNE enhances reporting capabilities by allowing administrators to fetch and include these custom attributes in its Microsoft 365 reports. This feature provides a streamlined way to align license usage with financial metrics or organizational hierarchies.
