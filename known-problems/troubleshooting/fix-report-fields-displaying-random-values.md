# FIX: Report fields displaying random values

Reports available in the LICLENS provide valuable insights into your organization’s usage data, helping administrators monitor and analyze various aspects of Microsoft 365 services. The platform ensures that your organization’s data is safeguarded by **trusted cloud security and privacy protections**, meeting the highest standards of security.

By default, Microsoft 365 usage reports conceal some user information, such as **usernames, groups, and sites**. This default setting helps protect privacy while still providing useful usage data. However, if needed, you can adjust these settings to **display concealed information**, depending on your organization's **privacy policies** or reporting needs.

#### Solution: Display Concealed Data in Reports

To make the concealed data visible, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Microsoft 365 Admin Center** using an account with **Global Admin** or **Reports Administrator** privileges.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Org Settings**.
3. Find the **Reports** section and look for the option called **“Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports.”**
4. **Tick this option** to allow concealed data to be shown in all usage reports across LICLENS reports.
5. **Save your changes**.
